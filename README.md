To use this locally run `npm run dev`, in prod use `npm run prod`. 

For local development you will need a `dev-config.js` which you can paramaterize for your messages as needed. It also contains a port param. A sample is provided, but it is included in the `.gitignore` to avoid accidental exposure.

Enjoy!
